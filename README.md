# Resource-Caching Gradle Plugin

The plugin allows to implement caching of resource files for web browsers like JavaScript and CSS files.
It aims to implement a technique called ["perfect caching"](http://www.gwtproject.org/doc/latest/DevGuideCompilingAndDebugging.html#perfect_caching) which Google uses for its framework GWT.
